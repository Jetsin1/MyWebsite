            <h1>PROJECT 1 : A BREAK IN</h1>
            <p>
                Project 1 was the first project that had forced me to think. The main objective was to recreate an entirely new narrative
                from a sample piece of video along with a completely seperate audio source that is not from the same video. This was a hard process
                due to the fact that creating a video with an audio, if it were to ever so slightly be off sync with one another, in terms of the chosen narrative as well as the 
                dynamic of the video could ruin it as a whole.
                <br>
                <br>
                I went for a horror narrative direction, by playing the footage in off beats and rearranging clips into perfectly timed areas
                I was able to create a suspensful ambience throughout the entirety of the video, though of course this would'nt have been possible without the effective use of background audio. Dark dreary music
                was a key factor in terms of making this horror genre themed video otherwise it would've just been stale and boring. The use of sound effects nearing towards the end of the video to give a sense of confusion 
                as well as fear of the unknown, during the jumpscare sequence as well allowed me to catch the viewers off guard when they think they are at the end of the video.
                <br>
                <br>
                There was a lot of back and forth throughout this process such as scrapping my entire original idea completely and going in a different direction for a narrative due to the fact that
                my original idea didn't have a strong enough foundation for itself. Here is the finished video coupled with a few of the original storyboards that I had planned out originally in order to create this video in the first place.

            <h1>PROJECT 2 : 9 icon design</h1>
            <p>
                A 9 icon creation was the objective for Project 2. My thought process throughout the creation of my 9 icons was to have same thematic look that being projectiles.
                All of the illustations that was created by me all have a sense of projectile showing a sense of movement through its line work. Whilst creating my 9 icons there was a struggle
                to keep it all the same look and elements in each of them because if some of the icons were too detailed comapared to the rest it would have given it a non themmatic look to it, as if not
                belonging in the same group and list of icons. 
                <br>
                <br>
                All of the icons demonstrate some form of motion which is a derivative of the main catogory being movement. Curved line work as well as motion colored blur was techinques used to create this illusion of
                movement coming off of an image. I believe that was the most challenging of this Project was being able to portray movement in a limited number of items available.

            <h1>PROJECT 3 : UNITY ENVIRONMENT CREATION</h1>
            <p>This video here shows my 3 stage environment progression that I have created within unity. One of the challenges of this project was actually thinking about
                what the environment change progression was going to be, I wanted it to be something close and personal to me. Initially I had other ideas for this project such as
                a forest being burnt down into a fire or the progression of war within in an enviornment and how it changes the surroundings but ultimately I came to the conclusion to
                stick with something personal. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This environment is a 3 stage journey that represents the different time periods of my life, the first being my first ever room I've ever had.
                I implemented all of the assets in from the unity store to create a room that closely resembles the one I have at home. The second stage of the environemnt 
                represents my highschool, a moment of time where I learnt many new things all at once, always being daunting to see from the distance as it I used to live about 5 minutes from my school.
                The third stage is the city, representing my move from Malaysia to melbourne, Melbourne felt like a very boxed in city with many restraints to me as well as a different mountaineous environement 
                compared to what I'm used to living in malaysia.
